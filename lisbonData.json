It is now used as a museum that you need tickets to access. The wildly opulent space houses a fantastic collection of decorative art, including chandeliers, marble statues, porcelain, tapestries, and much more. Some of the rooms are also used as gallery spaces for contemporary art exhibits. The property is pretty spectacular and overwhelming in its grandeur. There’s weight to every room considering how much there is to look at, whether it’s an old cabinet filled with porcelain cups or massive gold-framed portraits. If you’re into royal collections, this is likely the best you’ll find in all of Portugal.",

Envisioned as a gateway to the New World, the vibrant transportation hub has a ferry terminal on one side and trams whizzing by on the other, so it’s easy to weave into packed itineraries.

Before the Moors built the fortress in the mid-11th century, the Visigoths settled here. Later, after Dom Afonso Henriques became Portugal’s first king in 1147, it became the domain of royalty, and enjoyed a long time playing host to lavish soirees and visiting dignitaries. This castle certainly has a museum feel, what with its clever camera obscura offering 360-degree views of Lisbon in real time, archaeological site spanning three diverse periods, and ruins of the former royal palace. It’s the view, though, that’s the star. Peering out at the city’s abundance of red rooftops and the Tagus River beyond is one of Lisbon’s most thrilling rituals.",

Set on movie-set looking ground of an old manufacturing district, the LX Factory is a great place to get away from the more tourist parts and hang out amid the design firms, production studios, restaurants and shops — all having a design-centered focus. Very cool retail and restaurants, even a hotel, all tucked under the constant roar of the off/on ramps to the Big Bridge. It’s a destination place, so don’t do what I did and try to walk there from Barrio Alto on a 98 degree day! The cool thing is they didn’t gloss it up, but kept the place to its core history, with wonderful decay and industrial bones still in place. Two great places to be sure to check out: the 1300 Taberna restaurant, set in beautiful space with factory skylights and extremely nice people and, the Ler Devagar bookstore — which is the store that attracted me to this special place and often cited as one of the most beautiful bookstores in the world. It is set amidst an old printing plant, which like the rest of the area, they left all the old parts in place, so the whole bookstore is built around the old two story printing press, with seats, racks and even a cafe nestled amidst the old printing units, catwalks and folders. So cool. Worth the trip. A lot happenin’ here.",

The great quality of shoes made in Portugal is well known abroad.

Women can find heeled shoes or Oxford shoes (also known as men’s shoes). Men can find timeless classics. Everything sold is unique, trendy, and bold. After belonging to the same family for three generations, in February 2012 the shop was sold. But luckily, it was sold to another family!",

The cream of the Lisbon society has been its avid clientele since 1925, procuring high quality leather tailor made gloves for those days when the sunshine is not enough to warm the hands. At about 50€ per pair, depending on the model and leather, you do not have to go to Italy to get a product of this tremendous quality. A woman from Chicago once told me that she had visited Lisbon ten years ago, where she had the opportunity to purchase a single pair. She was so impressed and the gloves had left such a good memory that she was here to get three or four more pairs in case she did not have the opportunity to come back to Lisbon for another ten years.",

While you’ll certainly find your crop of classic stays, it’s not a city brimming with traditional hotels. The best places to stay in Lisbon provide a more immersive plunge into the culture of the old city, including self-serviced apartments designed to feel like a home away from home, former 18th century buildings renovated by famous Portuguese architects offering on-site communal dining, and a family home-turned-hotel where the family acts as your host. There’s also an abundance of stylish Airbnbs in any neighborhood of your choosing if you prefer to go that route. The one thing all of these stays have in common is they each serve as the perfect launchpad for exploring Lisbon’s labyrinth of vibrant old streets, bustling nightlife, evolving food scene and scenic beaches. Below, the 18 best Lisbon hotels and unique stays to book if you’re traveling to Portugal this summer.",

There are two major forces at play in Lisbon that make it a surprising contender as one of the world's more interesting coffee cities. First, Portugal's history as a colonial and maritime power have brought global influence to its relatively small capital for centuries—some cafés here are proud to exclusively stock beans from far-flung former colonies like São Tomé and Príncipe. Second, the influx of expats in recent years has given Lisbon more cosmopolitan influence than ever before, as well as freelancer-friendly spaces and a taste for third wave coffee. No matter what you're after, here is a cross-section of some of the best places to grab a cup next time you're in town. Read on for our editor's picks for where to get coffee in Lisbon.",

The espresso menu here is straightforward, which allows the high-quality, single-origin beans (from Ethiopia, Costa Rica, and elsewhere) to shine.",
