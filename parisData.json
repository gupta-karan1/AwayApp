From a lush inner courtyard steps lead to a bar, restaurant and subterranean speakeasy celebrating all things Eminente - the rum launched by Moët Hennessy with César Martí, Cuba's youngest Rum Master, at the stills. The casa is a riot of colour and Cuban charm, the building's classically French architecture transformed by touches of lapis and ochre, a jungle of potted tropical plants and bright, bold paintings selected by Havana-born Laura Salas Redondo. An evening of fabulous and rare-for-Paris rum cocktails is the main draw, starting with a classic Daiquiri and then moving on to specials from rotating monthly bartenders. If you want to go deeper, experiences include masterclasses and mixology sessions. Cuban hospitality shines through in the cosy, softly lit restaurant, where chefs rotate every two months. Alberto González, the first Cuban chef to win a Michelin star, is set to make a much-anticipated appearance in June. The spell is only cast until 19 July, when the mansion will be transformed back into a private home, so get there quickly.",

The Maison has now brought together some of its most iconic partnerships in an exhibition designed to showcase the vast expanse of Louis Vuitton's artistic and cultural work over the last 150 years. Titled LV Dream, the gallery takes visitors through specially curated rooms of multimedia art, textiles, furniture, perfumes, trunks and ready-to-wear items. The first room presents artistic interpretations of Vuitton himself by contemporary artists, such as a floor-to-ceiling digital moving portrait by multimedia artist Cao Fei and a painting of Gaston-Louis, Louis and Georges Vuitton by American figurative artist Alex Katz. Further along the exhibition, a psychedelic room designed by Kenta Cobayashi is dotted with cleverly designed 'Objets Nomades'. These are limited edition pieces of travel-inspired furniture created by designers from around the world, covering everything from a foldable stool to a packable (and very comfortable looking) camp bed. Other highlights included a look at the first three chapters of the Maison’s Artycapucines collection and creative collaborations with Japanese artists Yayoi Kusama and Takashi Murakami. The exhibition is free to enter, visitors need to book on the site. Olivia Morelli",

It would require weeks, even months perhaps, to browse each and every stall and stand in 14 different areas of alleyways and warehouses here – it’s vast. It’s best to attack it from Porte de Clignancourt (line 4 on the metro) – easy access to the market’s artery road, rue des Rosiers. With opening times from 10am-6pm on weekends and 11am-5pm on Mondays (excluding August), this is weekend reverie for magpies and photography buffs.

These are clothes that tell stories and promise less damage to your wallet and your fast-fashion conscience. It’s worth noting that cash offers can sometimes bag a bargain, and that the immaculately dressed shop assistants will not mince their words if you ask their opinion on that Burberry hat or Dior sunglasses.",

Enter the festival near Place du Tertre to pick up a souvenir glass and a splash of the Clos’ own wine before tasting your way from Alacse to Burgundy, fuelling up on saucisson or snails along the way.

The timeline is easy to follow as you move from room to room, only the extensive coverage of the Revolution a little heavy for those not wishing to become au fait with the day-by-day unfolding of the most tumultuous moment in French history.

Five years after the Fondation’s 2018 Jean-Michel Basquiat retrospective, this Spring Basquiat x Warhol: painting four hands celebrates his 1983-85 collaboration with pop art icon Andy Warhol. The collection brings together more than 80 paintings by the two artists, alongside videos, documents and photographs that tell the story of a friendship that captivated the art world. Opening with a series of portraits of Basquiat by Warhol and of Warhol by Basquiat, visitors are taken through galleries of vibrant, chaotic collaborative works that capture two distinct styles. Basquiat’s graffiti-inspired imagery, scribbles and slashes cover Warhol’s signature brand logos and newspaper headlines to create an energetic visual dialogue. Highlights include 10 painted punching bags (Last Supper) and the 10-metre-long canvas African Mask. The exhibition also features work by major artists such as Keith Haring, Jenny Holzer and Kenny Scharf, designed to evoke New York’s dynamic 1980s downtown art scene. This is a unique opportunity to experience one of the most important collaborations in modern art history that’s not to be missed.",

It’s a favourite with Parisians, who come here to practise tai chi, take the kids to a puppet show, grab a sundowner and pizza at trendy Le Pavillon Puebla or simply to relax with a bottle of wine and a sundown picnic.",

An Egyptian-style pyramid is the only original folly remaining today, but other distinctive features include a bridge modelled after Venice's Rialto, a Renaissance arch and a Corinthian colonnade. There are play areas, a carousel and scheduled puppet shows for kids. Throughout the park, look out for statues including those depicting composers Frédéric Chopin and Charles-François Gounod (known for 'Ave Maria'), and writer Guy de Maupassant. In 1797, André-Jacques Garnerin made history by landing the world's first parachute jump (from a hot-air balloon) in the park.",

The axe historique (historic axis), the western continuation of the Tuileries’ east–west axis, follows the av des Champs-Élysées to the Arc de Triomphe and, ultimately, to the Grande Arche in the skyscraper district of La Défense.

Three storeys above ground, it provides a unique aerial vantage point on the city. Along the first, northwestern section, above av Daumesnil, art-gallery workshops beneath the arches form the Viaduc des Arts. Staircases provide access (lifts here invariably don't work). Officially the Coulée Verte René-Dumont, it's better known as the Promenade Plantée. Waking southeast, look out for the spectacular art deco–style police station at the start of rue de Rambouillet, which was built in 1991 and is topped with a dozen huge, identical telamones (male figures used as pillars) based on Michelangelo's Dying Slave. The viaduct later drops back to street level at Jardin de Reuilly (1.5km); it’s possible to follow it all the way (4.5km) to the Bois de Vincennes. This latter section can also be done on a bike or in-line skates. A 1.7km section of the former Petite Ceinture, the steam railway line that encircled central Paris from the late 19th century until the line closed to passenger trains in 1934 and freight trains in the early 1990s, intersects the promenade 200m north of square Charles Péguy.",

The section of the vast gardens nearest the palace, laid out between 1661 and 1700 in the formal French style, is famed for its geometrically-aligned terraces, flower beds, tree-lined paths, ponds and fountains. The 400-odd statues of marble, bronze and lead were made by the most talented sculptors of the era. The English-style Jardins du Petit Trianon are more pastoral and have meandering, sheltered paths. Oriented to reflect the sunset, the Grand Canal, 1.6km long and 62m wide, is traversed by the 1km-long Petit Canal, creating a cross-shaped body of water with a perimeter of more than 5.5km. On the southwestern side of the palace, the Orangerie, built under the Parterre du Midi (southern flowerbed), shelters tropical plants in winter. The gardens’ largest fountains include the 17th-century Bassin de Neptune, a dazzling mirage of 99 spouting gushers 300m north of the palace, whose straight side abuts a small pond graced by a winged dragon (Grille du Dragon). On the same days as the Grandes Eaux Musicales fountain displays, the Bassin de Neptune flows for ten minutes. At the eastern end of the Grand Canal, the Bassin d’Apollon was built in 1688. Emerging from the water in the centre is Apollo’s chariot, pulled by rearing horses.",

Three museums from the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle and a small zoo, La Ménagerie, add to its appeal. Other attractions include peony and rose gardens, an alpine garden, and the gardens of the École de Botanique, used by students of the school and green-fingered Parisians. The beautiful glass-and-metal Grandes Serres, a series of four greenhouses, have been in use since 1714; several of Henri Rousseau's jungle paintings, sometimes on display in the Musée d'Orsay, were inspired by his frequent visits here.",

President Mitterrand commissioned the Chinese American architect I.M. Pei the task being the first time that a foreign architect was enlisted to work on the Louvre museum. The new structure – built in the same proportions of the famous Pyramid of Giza – alleviated the congestion from the thousands of daily visitors. Sunset is the best time to visit. ",

Fondation Le Corbusier is now used as a museum containing about 8,000 original drawings, studies and plans by Le Corbusier.

                "articleIntro":"One of the greatest myths about dining out in Paris is that you have to spend a lot to eat well. Even classic French cuisine is built on brilliant basics: seasonal ingredients, good-quality produce and the same menus served day in, day out. If you know where to look, it’s still totally possible to find big brasserie lunches for around €15, and a life-affirmingly good jambon-beurre for little more than €5. (Let’s be honest, is there anything more appealing than a fresh baguette slathered with salty butter – even if you later find crumbs in unexpected places?) Some of our latest faves show how the city’s culinary scene is changing, both in wine bars that are swapping rillettes or planches for pizzette and in a growing range of true-to-the-source restaurants and delis serving everything from Israeli to Sichuan cuisine untempered for European palates.
